* DONE Fix order matcher algo
* Remove non-necessary log messages
  Progress: Created Logger class. We can specify log level in main to remove debug messages.
  Need to make sure all debug/error messages are using this class;
* Fix output of program according to expected output
* DONE: Input validation
* DONE: Create test cases
    testSet2.txt  =  order causing trade in multiple orders
    testSet3.txt  =  order causing trade in multiple orders in multiple levels
    testSet4.txt  =  garbage input (invalid code, not csv, not convertible to int/double etc)
    testSet5.txt  =  input with invalid price (price <= 0)
    testSet6.txt  =  input with invalid size (size <= 0)
    testSet7.txt  =  input with invalid id (id <= 0)
    testSet8.txt  =  add_order with id that already exists in system
    testSet9.txt  =  cancel_order with arbit id
    testSet10.txt =  cancel_order with completed order
    testSet11.txt =  out of range input
* Create Expected Output test case
* Test suite runner
* Documentation
* Cleanup (Good OOP + naming etc)
* Comparison of performance (LL vs RBT)
